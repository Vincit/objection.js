# Changelog

## 1.0.0 ðŸŽ‰

### What's new

  * The static [`relatedQuery`](#relatedquery) method.
  * New reflection methods:
    [`isFind`](#isfind),
    [`isInsert`](#isinsert),
    [`isUpdate`](#isupdate),
    [`isDelete`](#isdelete),
    [`isRelate`](#isrelate),
    [`isUnrelate`](#isunrelate),
    [`hasWheres`](#haswheres),
    [`hasSelects`](#hasselects),
    [`hasEager`](#haseager),
    [`has`](#has).
    [`clear`](#clear).
    [`columnNameToPropertyName`](#columnnametopropertyname),
    [`propertyNameToColumnName`](#propertynametocolumnname).
  * `ManyToMany` extras now work consistently in queries and filters. [#760](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/760)

### Breaking changes

  * `modelInstance.$query().delete().returning(something)` now returns a single instance instead of an array. [#659](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/659)

  * Node 6.0.0 is now the minimum. Objection will not work on node < 6.0.0.

  * [`ValidationError`](#validationerror) overhaul. This is a big one, so read this carefully! There are three things to check when you migrate to 1.0:
    1. The [`createValidationError`](#createvalidationerror) and [`ValidationError`](#validationerror) interfaces have changed.
       If you have overridden the `createValidationError` method in your project, or you create custom `ValidationError` instances
       you need migrate to the interfaces.
    2. The model validation errors (jsonSchema violations) have remained pretty much the same but there are couple of differences. Before, the
       keys of `error.data` were property names even when a nested object in a graph failed a validation. Now the keys for nested
       validation errors are key paths like `foo.bar[2].spam`. Another tiny difference is the order of validation errors for each key in
       `error.data`. Let's say a property `spam` failed for your model and `error.data.spam` contains an array of objects that describe
       the failures. Before, the first failed validation was the last item in the array, now it is the first item.
    3. All [`ValidationErrors`](#validationerror) now have a `type` field. Before all [`ValidationErrors`](#validationerror) but the model
       validation errors (errors like "invalid relation expression", or "cyclic model graph") had no type, and could only be identified
       based on the existence of some weird key in `error.data`. The `error.data` is now removed from those errors and the `type` should be
       used instead. The message from the data is now stored in `error.message`.

  * Removed deprecated methods `whereRef`, `whereJsonField` and `whereJsonEquals`. The [`ref`](#ref) helper can be used to replace the
    `whereRef` calls. [`ref`](#ref) and [`lit`](#lit) can be used to replace the removed json methods.

  * `ManyToMany` extras now work consistently in queries and filters. [#760](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/760). This is not
    a breaking change per se, but can cause some queries to fail with a "ambiguous identifier" error because the join table is now joined
    in places where it previously wasn't. You need to explicitly specify the table for those failing columns using `Table.theColumn` syntax.

### Changes

  * `isFindQuery` is renamed to [`isFind`](http://vincit.github.io/objection.js/#isfind) and deprecated.

### Breaking changes

> Old model definition

```js
function Person() {
  Model.apply(this, arguments);
}

Model.extend(Person);

Person.tableName = 'Person';

Person.prototype.fullName = function () {
  return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
}

// More static and prototype methods.
```

> Easiest way to migrate to `class` and `extends` keywords

```js
class Person extends Model {

}

Person.tableName = 'Person';

Person.prototype.fullName = function () {
  return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
}

// More static and prototype methods.
```

  * Support for node versions below 4.0.0 has been removed. With it the support for legacy class inheritance using `Model.extend` method
    has also been removed. This means that you need to change your model definitions to use the `class` and `extends` keywords.
    To achieve this with the minimum amount of changes you can simply swap the constructor function and `Model.extend` to
    a class definition. You can still define all static and prototype methods and properties the old way. See the example on the right -->

    Note that this also affects Babel transpilation. You cannot (or need to) use `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes` anymore.
    See the [ESNext example project](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/tree/master/examples/express-es7) as an example of
    how to setup babel.

  * The default value of [`pickJsonSchemaProperties`](#pickjsonschemaproperties) was changed to `false`. Before, all properties that
    were not listed in `jsonSchema` were removed before `insert`, `patch` or `update` (if `jsonSchma` was defined). Starting from
    this version you need to explicitly set the value to `true`. You may have been used this feature by accident.
    If you have weird problems after the update, try setting `objection.Model.pickJsonSchemaProperties = true;` to see
    if it helps.

  * [`relate`](#pickjsonschemaproperties) and [`unrelate`](#pickjsonschemaproperties) methods now return the result of the
    underlying query (`patch` in case of `HasManyRelation`, `HasOneRelation`, and `BelongsToOneRelation`. `insert` otherwise).
    Before the method input was always returned.

  * `Model.RelatedQueryBuilder` is removed. `Model.QueryBuilder` is now used to create all query builders for the model.
    This only affects you if you have defined custom query builders.

 * [mergeEager](http://vincit.github.io/objection.js/#mergeeager) method.

### Breaking changes

 * `$relatedQuery` now returns a single model instead of an array for belongsToOne and hasOne relations. [#155](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/155)
 * identifier of a model can now be updated. Be careful with this one! Before if you forgot a wrong id in an `update`/`patch` operation, it would simply get ignored. Now the id is also updated just like any other column [#100](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/100)
 * `Table.*` is now selected by default in all queries instead of `*`. This will break some join queries that don't have an explicit select clause. [#161](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/161)
 * `ValidationError.data` is now an object including, for each key, a list of errors with context info. [#283](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/283)

## 0.6.2

### What's new

 * `relationMappings` can now be a function [#227](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/227)

## 0.6.1

### What's new

 * fix bug [#205](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/205)

## 0.6.0

 * Eager loading can now be done using joins and zero extra queries. See [`eagerAlgorithm`](#eageralgorithm), [`defaultEagerAlgorithm`](#defaulteageralgorithm) and [`eager`](#eager) for more info.
 * `#ref` in graph inserts can now contain extra properties for many-to-many relations [#156](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/156)
 * `#dbRef` can now be used to refer to existing rows from a `insertWithRelated` graph.
 * [`modelPaths`](#modelpaths) attribute for cleaner way to point to models in relationMappings.
 * [`pickJsonSchemaProperties`](#pickjsonschemaproperties) config parameter [#110](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/110)
 * [`insertGraphAndFetch`](#insertgraphandfetch) with `insertWithRelatedAndFetch` alias. [#172](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/172)
 * Added [`$beforeDelete`](#_s_beforedelete) and [`$afterDelete`](#_s_afterdelete) hooks [#112](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/112)
 * Old values can now be accessed from `$beforeUpdate`, `$afterUpdate`, `$beforeValidate` and `$afterValidate` hooks [#185](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/185)
 * Support length property [#168](ttps://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/168)
 * Make sure operations are executed in the order they are called [#180](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/180)
 * Fetch nothing if the `where` clauses hit no rows in `update/patchAndFetchById` methods [#189](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/189)
 * Lots of performance tweaks.
 * `$loadRelated` and `loadRelated` now return a `QueryBuilder`.

### Breaking changes

 * Undefined values as query method arguments now throw an exception. Before they were just silently ignored
   and for example `delete().where('id', undefined)` caused the entire table to be deleted. [skipUndefined](http://vincit.github.io/objection.js/#skipundefined)
   method can be called for a query builder to handle the undefined values the old way.

 * Deprecated method `dumpSql` is now removed.

 * `$loadRelated` and `loadRelated` now return a `QueryBuilder`. This may break your code is some rare cases
   where you have called a non-standard promise method like `reflect` for the return value of these functions.

## 0.5.5

### What's new

* [Virtual attributes](#virtualattributes)

## 0.5.4

### What's new

* bugfix: insertWithRelated now works with `additionalProperties = false` in `jsonSchema`
* Add updateAndFetch and patchAndFetch methods for `$query`
* bugfix: afterGet was not called for nested models in eager query
* Use ajv instad of tv4 for json schema validation

## 0.5.3

### What's new

* ES6 promise compatibility fixes.

## 0.5.1

### What's new

* [$afterGet](#afterget) hook.

## 0.5.0

### What's new

* [joinRelation](#joinrelation) family of query builder methods.
* `HasOneRelation` for creating inverse one-to-one relations.
* Relations have been renamed `OneToOneRelation` --> `BelongsToOneRelation`, `OneToManyRelation` --> `HasManyRelation`.
  The old names work, but have been deprecated.
* [withSchema](#withschema) now works as expected and sets the schema of all queries executed by the query builder the
  method is called for.
* [filterEager](#filtereager) method for better eager query filtering.
* [extra properties](#relationmappings) feature for selecting/inserting columns from/to the join table in many-to-many relations.
* Eager query recursion depth can be controlled like so: `parent.^5`.

## 0.4.0

### What's new

 * Query context feature. See [#51](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/issues/51) and [these docs](#context) for more info.
 * Composite key support.
 * [findById](#findbyid), [deleteById](#deletebyid), [whereComposite](#wherecomposite) and
   [whereInComposite](#whereincomposite) query builder methods.

### Breaking changes

There shouldn't be any major breaking changes. We moved from ES5 to ES7 + babel in this version so there are big changes
in the codebase. If something comes up, please open an issue.

There are a few known corner cases that may break:

 * You can now define a model for the join table of `ManyToMany` relations in `relationMappings`. This is optional,
   but may be needed if you already have a model for a `ManyToMany` relation *and* you use `snake_case`
   to `camelCase` conversion for the column names. See the documentation on the [through](#relationthrough)
   property of [relationMappings](#relationmappings).

 * The repo no longer contains the actual built javascript. Only the ES7 code that is transpiled when the code is
   published to npm. Therefore you can no longer specify a git hash to package.json to use for example the
   HEAD version. We will start to publish alpha and RC versions to npm when something new and experimental
   is added to the library.
