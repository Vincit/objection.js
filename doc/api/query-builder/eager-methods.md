# Eager Loading Methods

## withGraphFetched()

```js
queryBuilder = queryBuilder.withGraphFetched(relationExpression, graphOptions);
```

Fetch a graph of related items for the result of any query (eager loading).

There are two methods that can be used to load relations eagerly: [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) and [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined). The main difference is that [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) uses multiple queries under the hood to fetch the result while [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) uses a single query and joins to fetch the results. Both methods allow you to do different things which we will go through in detail in the examples below and in the examples of the [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) method.

As mentioned, this method uses multiple queries to fetch the related objects. Objection performs one query per level in the relation expression tree. For example only two additional queries will be created for the expression `children.children` no matter how many children the item has or how many children each of the children have. This algorithm is explained in detail in [this blog post](https://www.vincit.fi/en/blog/nested-eager-loading-and-inserts-with-objection-js/) (note that `withGraphFetched` method used to be called `eager`).

**Limitations:**

 * Relations cannot be referenced in the root query because they are not joined.
 * `limit` and `page` methods will work incorrectly when applied to a relation using `modifyEager` or `modifiers` because they will be applied on a query that fetches relations for multiple parents. You can use `limit` and `page` for the root query.

See the [eager loading](/guide/query-examples.html#eager-loading) section for more examples and [RelationExpression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression) for more info about the relation expression language.

See the [fetchGraph](/api/model/static-methods.html#static-fetchgraph) and [$fetchGraph](/api/model/instance-methods.html#fetchgraph) methods if you want to load relations for items already loaded from the database.

**About performance:**

Note that while [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) sounds more performant than [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched), both methods have very similar performance in most cases and [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) is actually much much faster in some cases where the [relationExpression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression) contains multiple many-to-many or has-many relations. The flat record list the db returns for joins can have an incredible amount of duplicate information in some cases. Transferring + parsing that data from the db to node can be very costly. You shouldn't select [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) blindly just because it sounds more peformant. The three rules of optimization apply here too: 1. Don't optimize 2. Don't optimize yet 3. Profile before optimizing. When you don't actually need joins, use [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched).

##### Arguments

Argument|Type|Description
--------|----|--------------------
relationExpression|[RelationExpression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression)|The relation expression describing which relations to fetch.
options|[GraphOptions](/api/types/#type-graphoptions)|Optional options.

##### Return value

Type|Description
----|-----------------------------
[QueryBuilder](/api/query-builder/)|`this` query builder for chaining.

##### Examples

Fetches all `Persons` named Arnold with all their pets. `'pets'` is the name of the relation defined in [relationMappings](/api/model/static-properties.html#static-relationmappings).

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .where('firstName', 'Arnold')
  .withGraphFetched('pets');

console.log(people[0].pets[0].name);
```

Fetch `children` relation for each result Person and `pets` and `movies`
relations for all the children.

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched('children.[pets, movies]');

console.log(people[0].children[0].pets[0].name);
console.log(people[0].children[0].movies[0].id);
```

[Relation expressions](/api/types/#relationexpression-object-notation) can also be objects. This is equivalent to the previous example:

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched({
    children: {
      pets: true,
      movies: true
    }
  });

console.log(people[0].children[0].pets[0].name);
console.log(people[0].children[0].movies[0].id);
```

Relation results can be filtered and modified by giving modifier function names as arguments for the relations:

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched('children(selectNameAndId).[pets(onlyDogs, orderByName), movies]')
  .modifiers({
    selectNameAndId(builder) {
      builder.select('name', 'id');
    },

    orderByName(builder) {
      builder.orderBy('name');
    },

    onlyDogs(builder) {
      builder.where('species', 'dog');
    }
  });

console.log(people[0].children[0].pets[0].name);
console.log(people[0].children[0].movies[0].id);
```

Reusable modifiers can be defined for a model class using [modifiers](/api/model/static-properties.html#static-modifiers). Also see the [modifiers recipe](/recipes/modifiers.md).

```js
class Person extends Model {
  static get modifiers() {
    return {
      // Note that this modifier takes an argument!
      filterGender(builder, gender) {
        builder.where('gender', gender)
      },

      defaultSelects(builder) {
        builder.select('id', 'firstName', 'lastName')
      },

      orderByAge(builder) {
        builder.orderBy('age');
      }
    };
  }
}

class Animal extends Model {
  static get modifiers() {
    return {
      orderByName(builder) {
        builder.orderBy('name');
      },

      filterSpecies(builder, species) {
        builder.where('species', species);
      }
    };
  }
}

const people = await Person
  .query()
  .modifiers({
    // You can bind arguments to Model modifiers like this
    filterFemale(builder) {
      builer.modify('filterGender', 'female')
    },

    filterDogs(builder) {
      builder.modify('filterSpecies', 'dog')
    }
  })
  .withGraphFetched(`
    children(defaultSelects, orderByAge, filterFemale).[
      pets(filterDogs, orderByName),
      movies
    ]
  `);

console.log(people[0].children[0].pets[0].name);
console.log(people[0].children[0].movies[0].id);
```

Filters can also be registered using the [modifyEager](/api/query-builder/other-methods.html#modifyeager) method:

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched('children.[pets, movies]')
  .modifyEager('children', builder => {
    // Order children by age and only select id.
    builder.orderBy('age').select('id');
  })
  .modifyEager('children.[pets, movies]', builder => {
    // Only select `pets` and `movies` whose id > 10 for the children.
    builder.where('id', '>', 10);
  })

console.log(people[0].children[0].pets[0].name);
console.log(people[0].children[0].movies[0].id);
```

Relations can be given aliases using the `as` keyword:

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched(`[
    children(orderByAge) as kids .[
      pets(filterDogs) as dogs,
      pets(filterCats) as cats

      movies.[
        actors
      ]
    ]
  ]`);

console.log(people[0].kids[0].dogs[0].name);
console.log(people[0].kids[0].movies[0].id);
```

Eager loading is optimized to avoid the N + 1 queries problem. Consider this query:

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .where('id', 1)
  .withGraphFetched('children.children');

console.log(people[0].children.length); // --> 10
console.log(people[0].children[9].children.length); // --> 10
```

The person has 10 children and they all have 10 children. The query above will return 100 database rows but will generate only three database queries when using `withGraphFetched` and only one query when using `withGraphJoined`.

## withGraphJoined()

```js
queryBuilder = queryBuilder.withGraphJoined(relationExpression, graphOptions);
```

Join and fetch a graph of related items for the result of any query (eager loading).

There are two methods that can be used to load relations eagerly: [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) and [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined). The main difference is that [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) uses multiple queries under the hood to fetch the result while [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) uses a single query and joins to fetch the results. Both methods allow you to do different things which we will go through in detail in the examples below and in the examples of the [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) method.

As mentioned, this method uses [SQL joins](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/tutorial-join.html) to join all the relations defined in the `relationExpression` and then parses the result into a graph of model instances equal to the one you get from `withGraphFetched`. The main benefit of this is that you can filter the query based on the relations. See the examples.

By default left join is used but you can define the join type using the [joinOperation](/api/types/#type-eageroptions) option.

**Limitations:**

 * limit and page methods will work incorrectly because they will limit the result set that contains all the result rows in a flattened format. For example the result set of the eager expression children.children will have 10 * 10 * 10 rows assuming the you fetched 10 models that all had 10 children that all had 10 children.

**About performance:**

Note that while [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) sounds more performant than [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched), both methods have very similar performance in most cases and [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) is actually much much faster in some cases where the [relationExpression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression) contains multiple many-to-many or has-many relations.

##### Arguments

Argument|Type|Description
--------|----|--------------------
relationExpression|[RelationExpression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression)|The relation expression describing which relations to fetch.
options|[GraphOptions](/api/types/#type-graphoptions)|Optional options.

##### Return value

Type|Description
----|-----------------------------
[QueryBuilder](/api/query-builder/)|`this` query builder for chaining.

##### Examples

All examples in [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) also work with `withGraphJoined`. Remember to also study those. The following examples are only about the cases that don't work with [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched)

Using `withGraphJoined` all the relations are joined to the main query and you can reference them in any query building method. Note that nested relations are named by concatenating relation names using `:` as a separator. See the next example:

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .withGraphJoined('children.[pets, movies]')
  .whereIn('children.firstName', ['Arnold', 'Jennifer'])
  .where('children:pets.name', 'Fluffy')
  .where('children:movies.name', 'like', 'Terminator%');

console.log(people[0].children[0].pets[0].name);
console.log(people[0].children[0].movies[0].id);
```

Using [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) you can refer to columns only by their name because the column names are unique in the query. With `withGraphJoined` you often need to also mention the table name. Consider the following example. We join the relation `pets` to a `persons` query. Both tables have the `id` column. We need to use `where('persons.id', '>', 100)` instead of `where('id', '>', 100)` so that objection knows which `id` you mean. If you don't do this, you get an `ambiguous column name` error.

```js
const people = await Person
  .query()
  .withGraphJoined('pets')
  .where('persons.id', '>', 100)
```

## allowGraph()

```js
queryBuilder = queryBuilder.allowGraph(relationExpression);
```

Sets the allowed tree of relations to fetch, insert or upsert using [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched), [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined), [insertGraph](/api/query-builder/mutate-methods.html#insertgraph) or [upsertGraph](/api/query-builder/mutate-methods.html#upsertgraph) methods.

When using [withGraphFetched](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphfetched) or [withGraphJoined](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#withgraphjoined) the query is rejected and an error is thrown if the [expression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression) passed to the methods is not a subset of the [expression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression) passed to `allowGraph`. This method is useful when the relation expression comes from an untrusted source like query parameters of a http request.

If the model tree given to the [insertGraph](/api/query-builder/mutate-methods.html#insertgraph) or the [upsertGraph](/api/query-builder/mutate-methods.html#upsertgraph) method isn't a subtree of the given [expression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression), the query is rejected and and error is thrown.

See the examples.

##### Arguments

Argument|Type|Description
--------|----|--------------------
relationExpression|[RelationExpression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression)|The allowed relation expression

##### Return value

Type|Description
----|-----------------------------
[QueryBuilder](/api/query-builder/)|`this` query builder for chaining.

##### Examples

This will throw because `actors` is not allowed.

```js
await Person
  .query()
  .allowGraph('[children.pets, movies]')
  .withGraphFetched('movies.actors')
```

This will not throw:

```js
await Person
  .query()
  .allowGraph('[children.pets, movies]')
  .withGraphFetched('children.pets')
```

Calling `allowGraph` multiple times merges the expressions. The following is equivalent to the previous example:

```js
await Person
  .query()
  .allowGraph('children.pets')
  .allowGraph('movies')
  .withGraphFetched(req.query.eager)
```

Usage in `insertGraph` and `upsertGraph` works the same way. The following will not throw.

```js
const insertedPerson = await Person
  .query()
  .allowGraph('[children.pets, movies]')
  .insertGraph({
    firstName: 'Sylvester',
    children: [{
      firstName: 'Sage',
      pets: [{
        name: 'Fluffy'
        species: 'dog'
      }, {
        name: 'Scrappy',
        species: 'dog'
      }]
    }]
  })
```

This will throw because `cousins` is not allowed:

```js
const insertedPerson = await Person
  .query()
  .allowGraph('[children.pets, movies]')
  .upsertGraph({
    firstName: 'Sylvester',

    children: [{
      firstName: 'Sage',
      pets: [{
        name: 'Fluffy'
        species: 'dog'
      }, {
        name: 'Scrappy',
        species: 'dog'
      }]
    }],

    cousins: [sylvestersCousin]
  })
```

You can use [clearAllowGraph](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#clearallowgraph) to clear any previous calls to `allowGraph`.

## allowEager()

::: warning
Deprecated! Will be removed in version 3.0. Use [allowGraph](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#allowgraph) instead. Note that you may need to add [clearAllowGraph](/api/query-builder/eager-methods.html#clearallowgraph) call too. `allowEager` cleared any old expressions automatically, while `allowGraph` merges them.

## mergeAllowEager()

## modifyEager()

```js
queryBuilder = queryBuilder.modifyEager(pathExpression, modifier);
```

Can be used to modify `withGraphFetched` and `withGraphJoined` queries.

The `pathExpression` is a relation expression that specifies the queries for which the modifier is given.

The following query would filter out the children's pets that are <= 10 years old:

##### Arguments

Argument|Type|Description
--------|----|--------------------
pathExpression|[RelationExpression](/api/types/#type-relationexpression)|Expression that specifies the queries for which to give the filter.
modifier|function([QueryBuilder](/api/query-builder/)&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;string&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;string[]|A modifier function, [model modifier](/api/model/static-properties.html#static-modifiers) name or an array of model modifier names.

##### Return value

Type|Description
----|-----------------------------
[QueryBuilder](/api/query-builder/)|`this` query builder for chaining.

##### Examples

```js
Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched('[children.[pets, movies], movies]')
  .modifyEager('children.pets', builder => {
    builder.where('age', '>', 10);
  })
```

The path expression can have multiple targets. The next example sorts both the pets and movies of the children by id:

```js
Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched('[children.[pets, movies], movies]')
  .modifyEager('children.[pets, movies]', builder => {
    builder.orderBy('id');
  })
```

This example only selects movies whose name contains the word 'Predator':

```js
Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched('[children.[pets, movies], movies]')
  .modifyEager('[children.movies, movies]', builder => {
    builder.where('name', 'like', '%Predator%');
  })
```

The modifier can also be a [Model modifier](/api/model/static-properties.html#static-modifiers) name, or an array of them:

```js
Person
  .query()
  .withGraphFetched('[children.[pets, movies], movies]')
  .modifyEager('children.movies', 'selectId')
```

## filterEager()

Alias for [modifyEager](/api/query-builder/other-methods.html#modifyeager).
