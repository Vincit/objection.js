# Minimal example project.

This example has the bare minimum to get you running queries and testing out things with objection. If you want to see a more realistic example, with multiple models, relations, a REST API etc. check out the [express example](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/tree/master/examples/express-es6)

# Install and run

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Vincit/objection.js.git objection
cd objection/examples/minimal
npm install
npm start
```
