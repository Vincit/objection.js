# ES7 example project

This is an example project that targets node 6.0.0 and up. The project
is a simple express server with a REST API that demonstrates the basic
functionalities of objection like models, relations, eager loading,
graph inserts, graph upserts etc. The code is modern ecmascript
and it is transpiled to ES6 using babel.

# Install and run

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Vincit/objection.js.git objection
cd objection/examples/express-es7
npm install
npm start
```

`client.js` file contains a bunch example requests and is a good place
to start playing with the REST API.

```sh
node client.js
```
